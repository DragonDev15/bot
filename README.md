# bot
A (stripped down) version of Animal Bot you can self host.
Commands have been stripped for various reasons. Two of them being they require API keys, or it just makes no sense to keep them.
## Setup
Fill in the .example.env like this: 
```
TOKEN=DISCORD BOT TOKEN
PREFIX=DISCORD BOT PREFIX
``` and rename it to .env
